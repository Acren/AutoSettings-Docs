***Why don't settings save when running Standalone mode from editor?*** 

By default Unreal disallows saving config from standalone mode, changes are not saved to config (but works fine in editor and packaged). If you go to **Editor Preferences > Level Editor - Play > Play in Standalone Game**, expand the advanced settings, and in **Additional Launch Parameters** put in `-MultiprocessSaveConfig`

This should allow standalone mode to save config and thus your settings will be saved.

***Can I use the menu from the example project? How do I integrate it with my project?***

You can. See the [example project page.](/example-project/#migrating-assets-from-the-example-project)

***Does the example project have gamepad navigation?***

Not yet. I'd like to do this eventually, but haven't had time yet.

***The example project has empty values for the scalability settings, why?***

The value falls back to the index of the array if empty. Makes it a bit faster to create scalability settings as they use 0 for low, 1 for medium, etc.
